### What is Ceaser Cipher?

A Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. It is one of the oldest types of ciphers and is based on the simplest monoalphabetic cipher. It is considered a weak method of cryptography, as it is easy to decode the message owing to its minimum security techniques. Caesar cipher is often incorporated only in parts of other complex encryption schemes.
